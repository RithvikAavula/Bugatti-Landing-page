Create a visually stunning, ultra-luxury Bugatti car website with modern, high-end animations and cinematic visuals. The design should reflect power, elegance, and speed, inspired by Bugatti’s identity — sleek curves, precision, and luxury craftsmanship.

Design style: Futuristic, dark mode theme with deep black, metallic blue, and electric cyan accents. Use neon highlights, motion parallax, smooth glassmorphism effects, and 3D transitions to create a feeling of depth and luxury.

Homepage:

Hero section with 3D model or cinematic video of a Bugatti car (like Chiron or Bolide) rotating in slow motion.

Bold title text like “Unleash the Power of Perfection” with a glowing light-trail animation.

Smooth scrolling and hover-based animations that reveal performance stats (horsepower, top speed, 0-100 acceleration).

Sections:

About Bugatti: Elegant storytelling with horizontal scrolling and text reveal animations.

Models Showcase: Interactive 3D gallery with car model cards — each expands on hover with a background morph effect.

Performance Section: Animated speedometer and stat counters.

Design & Innovation: Split-screen animations — left shows interior details, right transitions through concept visuals.

Contact / Test Drive: Minimalistic, elegant form with neon borders and glass blur background.

Animations & Effects:

GSAP and Framer Motion for scroll and reveal animations.

Lottie animations for icon transitions.

Hover-based glow and motion effects on car images.

Subtle engine rev sound effect when hero animation loads (optional).

Smooth transitions between pages with fade and slide motion.

Technical Stack (if coding):

React + Next.js

Tailwind CSS with Framer Motion

Three.js (for 3D car models)

GSAP for parallax and scroll-triggered animations

Tone & Feel:

Elegant, bold, and cinematic

Premium luxury brand energy

Emphasis on speed, precision, and artistry

Extra touch:
Add a “Night Mode Garage” section where the car glows with soft reflections and ambient lighting changes when hovering or dragging.
